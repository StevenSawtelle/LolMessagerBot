# LolMessagerBot

A simple script that runs forever until cancelled. It checks the top 10 hot posts on the /r/leagueoflegends subreddit and notifies a selected user if any of those posts' bodies contain a word from a list, which in this case is "bard, riot, pls, support" It is a very easy to understand program that I toyed around it with as I am learning Python, PRAW, and APIs. Use freely.
